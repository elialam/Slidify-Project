## About The Hair-Eye Color App 


* This App is part of the assignment for  "Developing Data Products" course 

* The app is developed using "Shiny" package in R.

* The app works based on HairEyeColor dataset in R packages

* The app consisits of 2 "Shiny"" files (ui.R and server.R) and 2 function files

* The app explores the distribution of poeple's Hair-Eye color mixture

* The app URL link is [Here](https://ellyshinyapps.shinyapps.io/HairEyeColorExplorer/)

## About the Hair-Eye Dataset

*** =left 

> * The dataset is a 3-dimensional array resulting from cross-tabulating 592 observations on 3 variables.

> * The variables and their levels are as follows:

>  No |	Name  |	 Levels
  ----| ------|-------------------------
   1  |	Hair 	| Black, Brown, Red, Blond
   2  |	Eye   |	Brown, Blue, Hazel, Green
   3  |	Sex 	| Male, Female 
   
*** =right

```{r,echo=F,fig.show='asis'}
library(reshape2)
mm = melt(HairEyeColor)
mm <- within(mm, {
  color <- tolower(Hair)
  color <- ifelse(color == 'blond', 'yellow', color)
  color1 <- tolower(Eye)
  color1 <- ifelse(color1 == 'hazel', 'gold', color1)
  value <- value / 2
  value1 <- value
})

mm <- melt(mm, id.vars = -(4:5))
cols <- c(apply(mm[1:16, c('color','color1')], 1, c))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mm, aes(x = interaction(Hair, Eye), y = value, fill = interaction(variable, interaction(Hair, Eye)))) +
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity') + facet_grid(Sex ~ .) + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') + scale_fill_manual(values = cols)

```

## Two main parts of any Shiny App

*** =left 
 
* ui.r file: 
   
  + contains the "User Interface" script
 
* Some User Interface widgets:
  
 + Action Button
 + A group of check boxes
 + A calendar to aid date selection
 + A file upload control wizard
 + A field to enter numbers
 + A set of radio buttons
 + A field to enter text
 + A submit button
 
*** =right 

* server.r file:
 
  + contains the "Server" script

  + script contains the instructions that your computer needs to build your app

  + Shiny server lets user manipulate the data

  + Shiny server lets users sort, filter, or change assumptions in real-time 

  + Shiny server empower users to customize analysis for their specific needs
